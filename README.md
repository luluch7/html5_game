		- Initial contents of jewel.js (boilerplate-like)
	end

	Listing 2-7 - Page 29
		- Created the jewel.load() function
		- How this works:
			- load function adds script to scriptQueue array
			- stores name + callback of file, and a Boolean flag to see if loading is complete
			- file is loaded as an image (not script) so that it is not executed
			- this will now load the script without execution
			- once file is loaded, onerror/onload handlers change the loaded flags
				- this will call the executeSCriptQueue() function then
	end

	Listing 2-8 - Page 30/31
		- Executing scripts in the queue
		- until everything is executed executeRunning will remain false
	end
